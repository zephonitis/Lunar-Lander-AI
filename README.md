# Lunar-Lander-AI
This is an AI agent which is architected to land between two points on Moon using deep Q learning.

The agent uses backpropagation to learn from the loss experiences in accordance with the target q values.

Uses softmax function to select the best q value out of the possible q values.

Uses Epsilon greedy approach to select the best action out of all the posibble actions.

Used gymnasium by OpenAI for the environment for the project in which agent performs various actions.
